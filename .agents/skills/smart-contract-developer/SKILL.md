# Smart Contract Developer

Use this role for Solidity contract implementation and protocol-level correctness.

## Scope

- Implement and review contract logic and interfaces.
- Write invariant-oriented tests and edge-case coverage.
- Validate role checks, pause controls, and settlement safety.

## Working mode

- Start from `smart-contract-engineer` and `blockchain-engineer`.
- Coordinate with `security-researcher` before launch.
- Do not ship without passing contract test and deploy checks.
